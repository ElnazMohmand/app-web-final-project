        BTS released their first single on June 12, 2013, and have been releasing songs and albums non-stop ever since then.

        <p>In the years since BTS’ first album, they’ve racked up an impressive discography that includes both Korean and Japanese albums. All of BTS’ songs and albums have personal meanings and stories behind them.</p>
        <p> Through all BTS’ albums, you can track the members’ lives as they grew up and had to learn to deal with their ever-evolving fame. You can also hear their life together, channeling all of the challenges life threw their way into their music.
        The main members of BTS that have worked as producers and songwriters include RM (Kim Namjoon), Suga (Min Yoongi), and J-Hope (Jung Hoseok), though other members have worked on songs as well. They’ve also worked as producers for other artists.</p>

            <li>Hidden Track: 길 Road/Path</li>
           </ol>
           <p>“No More Dream” was BTS’ first single ever, and, impressively, the lyrics were written by BTS band members RM, Suga, and J-Hope along with their producers.</p>
           <p>The lyrics to the single reveal a theme that the group revisited often in their early days: young people being pushed to go to school to fulfill the dreams of others and not necessarily their own.</p>

           <p>“We Are Bulletproof Pt.2” was their second single from the album. The lyrics discuss the hardships the group had already faced by being looked down upon by others, but overcoming all of the attacks with their hard work and dedication.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>“N.O” was the title track of O!RUL8,2?, and similarly to their first single “No More Dream,” “N.O” is about the pressure on students to become “studying machines,” even when it sacrifices their own dreams and happiness.
            This theme is also displayed in the music video for “N.O” where BTS members play students being fed pills in a classroom setting to make them complacent for their studies.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>“Boy In Luv” was the lead single of the album, and the lyrics of the song are about a typical high school crush, as well as a boys’ confusion over having feelings for the girl.
            Even with the cute theme of the song, BTS still put a hip-hop twist on the sound which makes it stand out.</p>

            <p>“Just One Day” was the second single off of Skool Luv Affair.
            Though this song has a similar theme to “Boy In Luv” it’s a much softer and and slower song. This allowed BTS to show off another side of their music for the first time in a single.</p>

           <p>The music video for “I NEED U” (Japanese Ver.) is interesting because it was filmed with a much different theme from the Korean version, unlike some of the previous Japanese versions of songs that ended up with music videos very similar to the Korean versions.</p>
